Plot legends identify discrete labels of discrete points.

Colorbar is a separate axes that can provide a key for the meaning of colors in a plot.


### Customizing Plot Legends

- *Sequential colormaps*: These are made up of one continuous sequence of colors (e.g., ``binary`` or ``viridis``).
- *Divergent colormaps*: These usually contain two distinct colors, which show positive and negative deviations from a mean (e.g., ``RdBu`` or ``PuOr``).
- *Qualitative colormaps*: these mix colors with no particular sequence (e.g., ``rainbow`` or ``jet``).
